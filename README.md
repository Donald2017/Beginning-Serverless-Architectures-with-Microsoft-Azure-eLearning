# Beginning Serverless Architectures with Microsoft Azure [eLearning]
Microservices is fast becoming the preferred approach for application development. In this course, you'll start with the basics and progress on to the advanced topics. You'll begin by working through a single function and work towards integration with other Azure services, such as App Insights and Cosmos DB. You'll also learn to handle common user requirements, such as analytics and the high-performing distributed storage. Last, but not the least, you'll also be provided the context that you need to get started on a larger project. 


## What you will learn
* Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of serverless development
* Build a fully-functioning serverless application with Azure services
* Define what serverless computing is and its technical basis
* Create, deploy, and manage your own Azure Functions in the cloud
* Architect greenfield serverless applications
* Integrate Azure Functions with legacy applications
* Interpret design principles for effective serverless code
